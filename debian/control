Description: Numerical solver package for quantum lattice models
 An exact diagonalization package for a wide range of quantum lattice
 models (e.g. multi-orbital Hubbard model, Heisenberg model, Kondo
 lattice model). Hhpi also supports the massively parallel computations
 The Lanczos algorithm for obtaining the ground state and thermal pure
 quantum state method for finite-temperature calculations are implemented.
 In addition, dynamical Green's functions can be calculated using Komega,
 which is a library of the shifted Krylov subspace method.
